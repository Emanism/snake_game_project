We are breaking down the game fun!
I used Pygame, a unique toolbox for games in Python. Variables are like storage lockers for info. Functions are mini-tasks telling the computer what to do, like 'update' and 'render.' Loops, like 'while True,' keep things moving.
Conditions make choices in the game, responding to what players do. Events, like pressing keys, make things happen. Colors make the game look fantastic, and the grid is like our game's paper with many squares. The clock helps us control how fast the game goes.
